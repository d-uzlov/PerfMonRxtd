# AudioAnalyzer plugin

AudioAnalyzer is a plugin for [rainmeter application](https://www.rainmeter.net).

It provides access to information extracted from "real-time" audio data for rainmeters skins.

## Usage

At the moment of writing this readme file plugin doesn't have a convenient formatted documentation.
Documentation in the form of several .txt files can be found [here](https://github.com/d-uzlov/Rainmeter-Plugins-by-rxtd/tree/master/AudioAnalyzer/documentation/user-documentation/).

Usage examples can be found [near documentation](https://github.com/d-uzlov/Rainmeter-Plugins-by-rxtd/tree/master/AudioAnalyzer/documentation/user-documentation/example-skins).

Main discussion can be found in the [plugin's Rainmeter forum thread](https://forum.rainmeter.net/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=29226).

Because of unrefined documentation release of the last version of this plugin hasn't been announced officially yet, so the link above contains outdated information about plugin.
Documentation improvement is in progress, so hopefully this won't be the case soon.

## Download

Archive with the last officially released verion can be found on [Releases page](https://github.com/d-uzlov/Rainmeter-Plugins-by-rxtd/releases/tag/AudioAnalyzer-v1.1.5).
