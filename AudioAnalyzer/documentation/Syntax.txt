There are only two types of measures in this plugin: Parent and Child.

Parent measure options:
Source : { Input, Output, <id> }
    Specifies device from which to capture audio.
    Input will grab default input device (such as microphone), output will grab default output device, such as speakers.
    You can specify exact id of some device to capture data from it instead of default devices.
    IDs have a following syntax: {0.0.0.00000000}.{22494623-1005-435a-8f61-4c8bae227550}
    Each computer have unique set of device ids. You can obtain a list of available ids with section variables "device list input" and "device list output".

Processing : string
	List of processing units separated by pipe symbol.
Processing-<id> : <list of suboptions>
	Description of processing unit.
	Contains list of channels and list of sound handlers.
	Possible suboptions: channels, handlers.
	Example: channels FrontLeft, FrontRigth | handlers rms, peak, fft, band
Handler-<id> : <list of suboptions>
	Description of a sound handler.
	Contains handler type and handler-specific suboptions.
	Possible types are: Loudness, Peak, FFT, BandResampler, BandCascadeTransformer, WeightedBlur, UniformBlur, ValueTransformer, Spectrogram, Waveform.
	See description of certain types of handlers for details.
FreqList-<id> : <list of suboptions>
	Description bound frequencies for band handler.
    Example: log 100 20 22500

TargetRate : integer >= 0 : 44100
	Target sampling rate. Sampling rate of computer's audio device can vary from 44100 (or maybe even less for some devices) to 192000 and potentially more. But you probably don't need that big sampling rate for sound analysis, and large sampling rates negatively affect performance.
	This plugin can apply low-pass filter to reduce effective sampling rate used in processing.
	Final rate is always >= than TargetRate. So if you rate is 48000 and TargetRate is 44100, then nothing will happen.
    If you sampling rate is less than TargetRate then nothing will happen.
	You probably don't want to change it from default.
	Set to 0 to disable resampling completely.



Child measure options:
Parent : string
	Name of the parent measure. Parent measure should be in the same skin.
Channel : string : Auto
	Channel to get data from.
	See Channels below for the list of possible values.
ValueId : string
	Name of the handler in parent measure.
Index : integer : 0
	Index of value in handler.
StringValue : { Number, Info } : Number
	When Number: string values of measure match number value.
	When Info: InfoRequest option determines string value of measure.
InfoRequest : string
	When StringValue=Info determines string value of measure.
	Usage: same as SectionVariables on parent measure, but without function call. E.g., "prop, frontLeft, band, bands count".
    See section variables documentation for details.
