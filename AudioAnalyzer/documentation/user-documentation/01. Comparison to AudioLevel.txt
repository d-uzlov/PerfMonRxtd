AudioAnalyzer is very simmilar to Rainmeter built-in AudioLevel plugin, however I believe AudioAnalyzer is much better in every way.

I believe, there are two basic requirements for an "audio plugin":
1. Provide a loudness data
2. Provide data for some fancy dynamic visualization.

AudioLevel plugin doesn't really have a correct loudness meter. It has "RMS" and "Peak" calculations, which will show you if there was any sound, but they won't really give you an insight on real loudness level. I will post loudness discussion somewhere nearby.
For fancy visualizations AudioLevel has some basic implementation of Fourier transform.
There is also an AudioLevel2, that can draw a waveform image.

AudioAnalyzer has much better ways to extract loudness information from audio stream, it has better implementation of fourier transform with ways to fight fundamental flaw of FFT algorithm, it also can draw a waveform, and it can draw a spectrogram (not a spectrum which only give you slice of frequency information, but a spectrogram).
By the way, drawing the spectrogram is the feature I was missing the most, and it was the main reason why I created this plugin in the first place.

On top of that, among other features, since version 1.1.5 AudioAnalyzer brings automatic switching between default audio devices (including WASAPI exclusive mode handling) and async computing for better UI performance.
