Plugin uses parent-child model. You should declare one parent measure and zero or more child measured to get information.

To make declaration of handlers more shorter and convenient they are declared in groups named Processing. A Processing declares that for each specified Channel there will be a sequence of specified sound Handlers. If one channel is noted in several Processings then the order of Handlers between different Processings is undefined.

For you FFT-chain you probably want to use the following:
FFT → BandResampler → BandCascadeTransformer → ValueTransformer
FFT will give you frequency amplitude information, BandResampler will transform it to desired bands, BandCascadeTransformer will improve precision on low frequency range, ValueTransformer will map values from raw linear range to something you desire.

If you don't want to use FFT cascades (see FFT-cascades guide), then you should get rid of BandCascadeTransformer.
