You can get information about parent measure itself or properties of handlers using section variable "resolve".
Use the following form: [&<ParentMeasureName>:resolve(<arg1>, <arg2>, <arg3>)]

Possible arguments:
"current device"
    "status" : 1 if everything works, 0 otherwise
    "status string" : 'active' if everything works, 'down' otherwise
    "type": type of current device. Possible values are "input" and "output".
    "nameOnly": name of the device. For example, "Realtek High Definition Audio".
    "description": specific type of current device. For example, "speakers".
    "id" : id of current audio device. For example, "{0.0.0.00000000}.{22494623-1005-435a-8f61-4c8bae227550}".
    "format" : human readable description of format of current device. E.g., "PCM 32b, 192000Hz, 5.1"
"device list input" : list of existing devices in the following format: "<id>;<description>;<nameOnly>". List is empty by default and is updated only on demand. Use bang [!CommandMeasure <ParentMeasureName> updateDevList] to update device list.
"device list output" : same as "device list input", but lists output devices.
For example:
[&MeasureParent:resolve(current device, name)]
[&MeasureParent:resolve(device list output)]

You can also get additional information from sound handlers. Different handlers can give you different values. See certain handlers' description for details.
To access info from handlers use the folloing syntax:
[&MeasureParent:resolve(prop, <channel>, <handler name>, <handler specific argument>)]
For example:
[&MeasureParent:resolve(prop,frontLeft,band,bands count)]
