AudioAnalyzer [1.1]

This plugin is created to extract data from computer audio in "real time".
This plugin can measure loudness and peak of sound wave, do Fourier Transform, draw waveform, draw spectrogram.
This plugin was inspired by AudioLevel plugin, but there are significant differences.



Detailed documentation:



FFT chain:
Transforming FFT result into bands can be quite complex, depending on what you want to get.

3) You want to perform blurring or time filtering.
There are several places where you can add handlers for this.
Between BandResampler and BandCascadeTransformer can be handlers of types WeightedBlur, UniformBlur, FiniteTimeFilter in any variations. You can use none, you can use blur only, you can use blur and then filtering, etc.
You can also place handlers after BandResampler: UniformBlur, FiniteTimeFilter, LogarithmicValueMapper, also in any variations.
You can't place LogarithmicValueMapper before BandResampler, you can't place WeightedBlur after BandResampler.
I don't know which combination of handlers will give you better results.
