## Mentions

PerfMonRxtd is heavily inspired by [PerfMonPDH](https://forum.rainmeter.net/viewtopic.php?f=128&t=28937).

Originally it was planned as a modification of PerfMonPDH with few added features, but it was completely rewritten in the process.

PerfMonRxtd got its terrible name from PerfMonPDH, critical lack of imagination, and bad naming skills.
