# PerfMonRxtd plugin

## Overview

PerfMonRxtd is a plugin for [rainmeter application](https://www.rainmeter.net).

PerfMonRxtd provides access to windows perfmon.exe data with useful postprocessing for rainmeter skins.

## Usage and download

At the moment of writing this readme file plugin doesn't have a convenient formatted documentation.
Documentation and some basic examples in the form of .txt file can be found [here](PerfMonRxtd/documentation/user-documentation-txt/documentation.txt).

Main discussion and usage examples can be found in the [plugin's Rainmeter forum thread](https://forum.rainmeter.net/viewtopic.php?f=18&t=29226).

## Mentions

PerfMonRxtd is heavily inspired by [PerfMonPDH](https://forum.rainmeter.net/viewtopic.php?f=128&t=28937).

Originally it was planned as a modification of PerfMonPDH with few added features, but then it was completely rewritten in the process, so it became an independent plugin.

PerfMonRxtd got its terrible name from PerfMonPDH and critical lack of imagination.

## Building

Plugin LocalPluginLoader can be built as a part of solution that contains everything in the repository.
See [main readme](README.md) for details.
